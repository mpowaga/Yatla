                                                Tasks

 ☐ make the code more efficient, BACKUP SUCKS
 ☐ when you create a task, make sure, task name doesn't repeat
 ☐ resize signal check_resize.connect ()
 ☐ delete button border when the button is clicked
 ☐ add the notification's pop ups
 ☐ solve the problem with importing the database (the problem is after import, i select an item an it writes that gtk_container_remove couldn't be done, still the programm works normally)
 ☐ add a button which calls task_preferences, only when tooltip opens
 ☐ task_preference two types: 1) to create a task 
                               2) to edit a task
 ☐ create transition for sidebar (Gtk.Stack)
